[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

The numbers generated by random.random are supposed to be uniform between 0 and 1; that is, every value in the range should have the same probability.
Generate 1000 numbers from random.random and plot their PMF and CDF. Is the distribution uniform?
First we generate 1000 random numbers and plot it's PMF using a histogram with bin size 1.
```python
import pandas as pd
randn = pd.DataFrame(np.random.random(1000), columns=['num'])
randn.num.hist(bins=1000)
```

We can see that because each outcome of the random variable has a low chance of occuring resulting in low counts, its difficult to tell whether the distribution is uniform. To address this, we can look at the CDF which deals with these values better.
```python
randn.num.hist(cumulative=True, bins=1000)
```

We can see that the CDF gives a better picture of the distribution when probabilities are low. In this case, we can see that the function random.random is indeed random.
